# Bayesian Inversion for Ptychography with Deep Generative Priors

This repository contains the official implementation of the paper **"xxxx"** by xxxx.

## Overview

Include the abstract of the paper here.

## Key Features:

- **Bayesian Framework:** Incorporates a Bayesian approach to inversion, allowing for principled uncertainty quantification in the reconstructed images.
- **Generative Priors:** Utilizes generative models as priors, improving the reconstruction quality by leveraging learned representations of image data.
- **Modular Design:** The code is designed to be modular, making it easy to adapt and extend for different generative models or imaging settings.
- **GPU Support:** The implementation is optimized for GPU acceleration using PyTorch, enabling efficient computation even for large-scale problems.
- **Reproducibility:** Scripts to reproduce the experiments from the paper, including comparisons with rPIE.
