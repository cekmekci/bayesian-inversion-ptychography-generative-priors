## Overview

xxxx

## Features

- **Implementation of ULA+GM:** The core implementation of the unadjusted Langevin algorithm (ULA) as described in the paper.
- **Numerical Experiments:** Scripts to reproduce the experiments from the paper, including comparisons with rPIE.

## Repository Structure

- `./models/` - Includes a pre-trained Wasserstein GAN model for generating ptychographic objects of interest.
- `./utils/` - Contains some utility functions for data-loading, ptychography, and training.
